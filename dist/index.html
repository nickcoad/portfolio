                        <p>
                            My name is Nick Coad and I'm a web developer from Launceston, Tasmania. I've been practicing web development in my
                            spare time for 15 years and professionally for 6 years - first as a contracted freelance web developer and currently
                            as a full-time web developer for VETtrak Pty Ltd.  I have a wide range of web-based skills and knowledge all of which
                            are summarised on this page.

                                <p>
                                    During my time at OzSoft as a Database Software Support officer, I was offered a position as a web developer
                                    at another company. OzSoft had no web developers at all but made a new position for me so I could stay on as
                                    OzSoft's web developer. (The company has since rebranded to VETtrak Pty Ltd).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The web development role covered everything web related at the company as I was the only web developer on
                                    staff.  This included the re-development of the OzSoft website using Sitefinity, an ASP.NET based CMS. This
                                    project included many custom integrations with the Sitefinity software so that customers in our proprietary
                                    customer management software could use their existing credentials to log into the CMS and manage their
                                    records with us.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The role also included the development of four software products that we subsequently released for sale.
                                    Details on two of the larger projects - the VETtrak Trainer Portal and the VETtrak Student Portal can be
                                    found in the Portfolio section.

                            This project included the development of a C# API to communicate with the VETtrak database in a way that respected the business logic already
                            present in the software, so that information entered through the API is stored and managed in the same way as data entered through the main
                            software.

                        <p>
                            The VETtrak Student Portal is designed to integrate with VETtrak Pty Ltd's primary software solution VETtrak<sup>&reg;</sup>. The Student Portal
                            allows our customers to provide their students with a username and password that they can use to sign and view their course progress and upload
                            or download files against units of competency. This allows a student to submit file-based evidence for trainers to review through the Trainer
                            Portal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project also makes use of the C# API developed for the Trainer Portal.

                            This project is a design-only project for a friend's business venture that didn't eventuate. I was asked to provide a design that looked
                            modern and communicated a sense of health and well-being. Using stock photography of people undergoing exercise both in the gym and in nature
                            gave the site a fresh and healthy look.
